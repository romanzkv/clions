So, in order to learn go, and do an open-project app, I decided to implement the "interactive" cli thingy
modern mc implemented in go.

# Hello world - curses
I added the import  "github.com/gbin/goncurses" but how to add it go.mod?
and how to install these dependencies?
let see if this [doc](https://go.dev/doc/modules/managing-dependencies) can help
